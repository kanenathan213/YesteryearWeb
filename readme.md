# HeyDay

This is a project to build a web, iOS, and Android app to deliver better audio tours at historically meaningful places. The initial focus is on museum tours.

I'm building it with React DOM and (eventually) React Native. Facebook for auth and Stripe for payments.

## To install:

`npm install`

## To run:

`gulp`
